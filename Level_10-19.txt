Bandit Level 12 → Level 13

Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

    Hex dump on Wikipedia

Sol:
As you can see, this level sucks. Luckily, once you get used to each command,it goes smoothly, if not quickly. 
You want to start by moving the file to the /tmp/YourName directory so that you can work on it with write permissions.
You must then use xxd to convert it out of a hex format and back into the compressed format. 
From there you use the file command to determine what sort of file it is.
In this case it is a gzip file, so we rename it to .gz then use the gzip command to uncompress it. 
This process basically repeats for an absurd number of times using gzip, bzip2, and tar. 
Eventually you will run the file command and it will tell you that you have an ASCII file

*****************************************************************
Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. 
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 

bandit13@bandit:~$  ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

"sh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost" used because we have sshkey.private and also mentioned that localhost is a hostname.
so we directly ssh into server without password.
